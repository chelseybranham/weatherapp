My Weather App!


I created this as practice with using API data. It pulls weather data and provides a forecast for the next 7 days.

How It's Made:
Tech used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap



Optimizations
In the future I would love to work on making the timestamp shorter, ensuring the values do not concatonate and instead clear when the user hits the button to search again.

Lessons Learned:
I learned so much about fetch and APIs through this project!
